# MongoDB Atlas Verification Guide

## Connection Status

We've verified that your application is successfully connecting to MongoDB Atlas. The server logs show:

```
Connected to MongoDB
Server listening on port 4000
```

We also ran a test script that confirmed the connection and showed the available collections:

```
Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas

Available collections:
 - payments
 - loans
 - users

Document counts:
 - payments: 0 documents
 - loans: 0 documents
 - users: 0 documents
```

## Current Status

Your MongoDB Atlas connection is working correctly, but there are currently no documents stored in any of the collections. This means:

1. Your application is properly configured to connect to MongoDB Atlas
2. The database and collections are created
3. No data has been added yet

## How to Add and Verify Data

### Method 1: Using the API

1. **Register a User**:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/register
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "role": "finance",
     "name": "Test User",
     "financeName": "Test Finance",
     "uniqueId": "test123",
     "password": "password123"
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Loan**:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:4000/api/loans
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "loanId": "LOAN001",
     "shopkeeperName": "Test Shop",
     "shopkeeperPhone": "1234567890",
     "amount": 10000,
     "startDate": "2023-10-01",
     "duration": 30,
     "interestRate": 5,
     "status": "active"
   }
   ```

3. **Record a Payment**:
   ```
   POST http://localhost:4000/api/payments
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "loanId": "[loan_id_from_response]",
     "date": "2023-10-02",
     "status": "paid"
   }
   ```

### Method 2: Using MongoDB Atlas Dashboard

1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Navigate to your cluster
3. Click on "Browse Collections"
4. You should see your database and collections

### Method 3: Run the Verification Script

After adding data through the API, run the verification script again to confirm data is being stored:

```
node test-mongodb-connection.js
```

You should see document counts greater than 0 for the collections where you added data.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with data storage:

1. **Check API Responses**: Ensure your API calls return success status codes (200, 201)
2. **Verify MongoDB Connection String**: Your connection string in .env is correct
3. **Check Network Access**: Ensure your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
4. **Check Database User**: Verify the username and password in your connection string

## Conclusion

Your application is correctly configured to use MongoDB Atlas. The connection is working properly, and the database structure is set up. You just need to add data through your application's API endpoints to start seeing documents in your collections.
